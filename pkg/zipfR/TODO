For release 0.7:
  - factor out confint estimators from confint.lnre so they can be used with other bootstrapping tasks
  - implement "lexical constants" as productivity measures (lexconst.spc, lexconst.lnre?) with (approximate) confidence intervals for LNRE models
  - add code examples for lnre.bootstrap (once implementation of confint estimators and productivity measures is complete)

Further tasks:  
  - revise all built-in data sets
    - update internal format (e.g. avoid factors, make N numeric rather than integer, etc) so they are identical after round-trip through disk file
    - convert all factors (for types) to character
    - verify that encodings for non-ASCII data are set appropriately
    - save with xz compression, especially for larger data sets
    - but make sure to use version=2 so the package is still compatible with R < 3.5.0
  - implement lnre.productivity.measures()
    - empirical bootstrap estimates should be fairly easy
    - approximate expectation and variance estimates where the mathematics can be worked out
    - don't forget to remove from .Rbuildignore then!
  - complete implementation of posterior type distributions for ZM and fZM models (after writing down the mathematical equations precisely)
  - custom code for posterior density, extended to m=0 for models with finite S
  - model-based Good-Turing estimates with function gtlnre()
