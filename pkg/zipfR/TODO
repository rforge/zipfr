  - implement "lexical constants" as productivity measures (lexconst.spc, lexconst.lnre?) with (approximate) confidence intervals for LNRE models
  - complete implementation of posterior type distributions for ZM and fZM models (after writing down the mathematical equations precisely)
  - custom code for posterior density, extended to m=0 for models with finite S
  - auto.gzfile() helper no longer needed -> remove
  - add encoding options to read.tfl
