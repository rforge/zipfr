For release 0.7:
  - implement MTLD (and perhaps other measures based on token vector) separately; doesn't fit in API for productivity measures
  - add code examples for lnre.bootstrap() (once implementation of confint estimators and productivity measures is complete)
  - add examples for productivity.measures()

Upcoming:
  - posterior distribution functions using LNRE models as a Bayesian prior,
    with type density postdlnre(), log-transformed density postldlnre(), as well as
    cumulative probability postplnre() and quantiles postqlnre() for selected models
    - complete implementation of posterior type distributions for ZM and fZM models (after writing down the mathematical equations precisely)
    - custom code for posterior density, extended to m=0 for models with finite S
  - Good-Turing estimates with gtlnre()

Further tasks:  
  - implement plot method for LNRE models (log type or probability density)?
  - consider mixture models
    - two or more LNRE models with specified mixing factors
    - parameter estimation may become quite tricky
    - mixture of LNRE model with finite distribution (for lexicalised types) would be interesting
    - alternative: special extension for lexicalised types, piecewise Zipf models
  - reconsider parameter estimation: can we include top of Zipf ranking?
  - revise all built-in data sets
    - update internal format (e.g. avoid factors, make N numeric rather than integer, etc) so they are identical after round-trip through disk file
    - convert all factors (for types) to character
    - verify that encodings for non-ASCII data are set appropriately
    - save with xz compression, especially for larger data sets
    - but make sure to use version=2 so the package is still compatible with R < 3.5.0
  - improve performance of sample.tfl / zipfR.tflsplit with rmvhyper (from package extraDistr)?
    - adds dependency on a heavy Rcpp-based package only because of a rarely-used function
    - alternative: re-implement incremental splitting procedure with rhyper() in C
